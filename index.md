# Ball Tracking Robot with OpenCV: Computer Vision

This project is about making a ball-tracking robot using OpenCV, a Python library for computer vision. The robot has a Raspberry Pi computer, a PiCamera for detecting the ball, DC motors for moving the wheels, and ultrasonic sensors to avoid collisions. Each part works together to create a robot that can follow a ball.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code


```python
 import cv2
        
        vid = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
        
        while(True):
            ret, frame = vid.read()
            height = frame.shape[0]
            width = frame.shape[1]
            
            if ret:
                
                # frame_r: resized tensor H/4,W/4, 3
                frame_r = cv2.resize(frame, (width//4,height//4))
                
                #swap channels (BGR)
                cv2.imshow('frame', frame_r[:,:,[2,1,0]])
                #cv2.imshow('frame', frame_r)
        
            if (cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q')):
                break
                
        vid.release()
        cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
